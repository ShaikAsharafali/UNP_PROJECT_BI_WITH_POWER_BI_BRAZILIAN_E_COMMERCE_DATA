# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA

I did this project in collaboration with UNP. The Brazilian E-Commerce Dashboard provides key insights into customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, and business performance. It analyzes the total number of unique customers, their geographic distribution, and shopping trends across different states and cities. The dashboard tracks order trends over time, including order statuses, processing times, and delivery performance.

Additionally, it examines order pricing, freight costs, and total revenue generated, helping businesses understand pricing dynamics. Payment analysis covers preferred payment methods, installment trends, and total payment values. Customer feedback is also explored through review scores and comments, identifying patterns in customer satisfaction.

By integrating multiple datasets, the dashboard offers a holistic view of the Brazilian e-commerce landscape. It enables businesses to optimize logistics, improve customer experiences, and refine pricing and marketing strategies, ultimately driving data-driven decision-making in the e-commerceÂ industry.
